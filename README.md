# AUTO-FILES-ORGANISER
Auto file organization:

Hey welcome this is my python program known as Auto file organizer. So basically, this project is about auto file organization. So, it is useful for managing and arranging different type of file in well manner and in a structured way. Now we have a problem so firstly discuss about the problem so there are folder which have different types of files like pdf, mp3, mp4 which is look like inappropriate and not in proper manner. If we go manually to arrange than it takes much time to arrange in proper manner.
So, python have a solution to this problem. Let discuss the python code to solve the above problem. First of all we import os module which operates with our operating system and we are also using glob function of glob module to detect all the files inside the current directory. After this we are going to create set of extensions inside the folder to avoid the same entries to store all the extensions files. Here we are using for loop in file in files_list so what actually happens here that any files in files_list automatically goes to loop and then the extensions of the file is stored into the extensions and automatically goes to extensions set. So here the for loop is repeated until all the files are stored in single extensions set. 
So here now define a function to create a directory for each type of extensions named s createdirs (). So It will make different folders based on their extension And then we define our next function to move files based on their extension to the respective folder named as arrange().so the last step is that we are call the function createdirs() and arrange(). And that’s it. Our program is done . 
let’s run it …
so basically our program is runing successfully .  Let's see the result. Ok its working.

So, that’s it 
Thanks for watching.
